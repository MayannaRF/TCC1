\chapter*{Abstract}


\noindent Technology is ubiquitous today, this is largely due to the internet
of things, since it enabled the automation of various equipment. Despite this automation, the equipment was not completely independent since there is still dependence on electricity. Some of these equipments have a battery source of energy, which has a limited useful life, so knowing how much energy will be consumed becomes essential. A good part of the energy consumption comes from the algorithms that are working on the platform. Currently, there are already several models to calculate the energy consumption of algorithms on embedded platforms, but they are not completely efficient, so the proposal would be to combine more than one of these models for greater efficiency and accuracy in measurements. In order to carry out experiments, the present work proposes to explore a platform called Repito
so that you can profile the energy consumption of some algorithms
implemented in embedded systems.

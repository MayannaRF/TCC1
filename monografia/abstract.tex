\chapter*{Abstract}


\noindent The technology is ubiquitous today, this is due in large part because of the internet of things, since it enabled the automation of various equipment. many of those automation systems as a central platform for an embedded system. This work proposes to explore a platform called Repito so that it can outline the energy consumption profile of some algorithms implemented in embedded systems.
 
 \textbf{Keyword}: Embedded systems, energy profile, internet of things.
